        text: 'The Punkt civic association was established in 2007 to promote and support research in the fields of design, fine arts, architecture and urbanism. They have gradually expanded our intention to comprehensively support the development of the city at various levels: support for community life and the local economy, linking the needs of the population with urban development, as well as responsible waste management and its reduction in practice. Through the scope of their activities, they have become the only non-profit organization of its kind in Slovakia. This year the Punkt started new activity, CTZN, platform/magazine on people and cities.'
